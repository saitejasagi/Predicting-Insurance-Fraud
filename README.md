Predicting Fraud in Insurance policies
Fraud costs insurance companies billions of dollars every year. Most of the insurance companies now a days want to better understand fraud, its impact on the company and how they can better control it using advanced analytics.

We have insurance data from a unanimous company. My aim is to better predict the fraud cases by using machine learning models. 
The main purpose behind creating this repository is to apply several different models on the data to understand the factors that relate to fraud and to predict the fraud before hand. I will explore several models such as KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forests and Naive Bayes etc. and see whcih model is the best in predicting fraud. 

Defining a single ideal metric to judge the model performance is not the correct approach because we have class imbalance in target variable levels. I have discussed the techniques to address the class imbalance issues, and decided the best performing models based on several metrics like recall, AUC, etc. and came to a holistic conclusion.

I referred to several articles in channels such as Towards Data Science, Geeks for Geeks for my project.I have run the code on jupyter notebook and documentted the report in word format. That data in excel format is also given in the repository.
